# Dual-Port-Ram-Design-and-Verification-System-Verilog-Microprocessor-System-Design-
Implemented and analyzed driven stimulus verification for the Dual Port RAM
Implemented and analyzed driven stimulus verification for the Dual Port RAM, achieving 99% data accuracy and significantly 
reducing data mismatches, which enhanced hardware design quality and functional accuracy, resulting in a 25% reduction in 
design iterations and a 20% increase in project delivery speed
â€¢ Owned and refined DV test benches, checkers, trackers, scoreboards, monitors and assertions utilizing UVM methodologies, 
directing the creation and execution of a SystemVerilog testbench for Dual Port RAM that improved read/write operation.
